This is a sample react native project that contains integration of
Redux Toolkit Query with Typescript.

Feature based project structure has been setup in it.

After you write createAPI query, then configure reducer and middleware in your store

and then provide this store to a provider that wraps your whole application in App.tsx

Loading and Error states have also been handled in product.tsx
