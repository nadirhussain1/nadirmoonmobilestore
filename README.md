This project was initially started as a demo application that integrated
Redux Toolkit Query with tyepscript. However, then I thought to extend it and
build enterprise level architecture.

Theme and Styling:
I have integrated react-native-paper library for base components. Then wrappers
have been written over its component to maintain consistency in whole application.

State Management and API Integration:

Redux toolkit has been integrated for state management and RTKQuery has been used for
api integration.

There will be video tutorials on my youtube channel @nadirhussainar to explain the concepts related with Redux architecture, ReduxToolkit and RTKQuery.
